MAINMENU_TUTORIAL_COMBAT3,Ah!, and by the way, welcome to your island! Everything you see is yours!
MAINMENU_TUTORIAL_COMBAT4,I'm happy you came back with that loot!, you can do many things with it, but don't worry I won't burden with all of it at the moment. \nEnjoy your Island!
MAINMENU_TUTORIAL_RECRUITMENT1,Time to explain, coins will let you recruit cats!, remember that we want to become the number 1 Pirate Cat Crew, and to achieve that, we need a team.
MAINMENU_TUTORIAL_RECRUITMENT2,There are some picky Cats that will charge you a bigger amount of coins, so check the prices first, but don’t worry they’re all experts, they’ll be worthy.
MAINMENU_TUTORIAL_RECRUITMENT3,Ehem… I know this may sound weird, but all of us here are cosplayers, we are Cosplayer Pirate Cats, and wearing different costumes makes us feel stronger, so please visit the Cosplay shop as well and get us some awesome stuff from there! 
MAINMENU_TUTORIAL_RECRUITMENT4,Now go and recruit a bunch of cats! Only because is for you, the first recruited cat will go with you for free!
MAINMENU_TUTORIAL_ISLAND1,When you recruit cats, you’ll see them wandering around the island, select any of the Cats and you’ll be able to change their cosplay or manage your crew.
MAINMENU_TUTORIAL_ISLAND2,Now go for a walk across your Island!
MAINMENU_TUTORIAL_ISLAND3,One more thing before I forget, if you just wanna go and keep fighting, tap on your ship and choose the option <B><color=#302DD2>Fight!</B></color>
MAINMENU_TUTORIAL_CREW1,Your Crew is made up of 4 great Pirates, here in the <color=#302DD2><B>Crew Management</color></B> you can choose  the big 4 you want for the next fight.
MAINMENU_TUTORIAL_CREW2,Tap on the cat you want to switch from your ship, then tap the cat you want from the cat list and that's it! (it works viceversa too!)

TUTORIAL_COMBAT_1,Hold on, Pirate! I know you can’t wait to win to those Kitty Cats using our powerful <B>Big Purrr Cat force</B>, but let me tell you the basics
TUTORIAL_COMBAT_2,The 4 of us in your crew are in charge of different attacks inside the ship
TUTORIAL_COMBAT_3,One is in charge of the <color=#0000FF> <B>Basic Cannon </color></B>, tap on the middle of the screen to shoot it. You can shoot it as many times as you want
TUTORIAL_COMBAT_4,Two are in charge of the <color=#0000FF><B>Strong Cannons</color></B>, tap on the left or right of the screen to shoot them. They’re strong, but you’ll need to wait for them to cool down before shooting again, pay attention!
TUTORIAL_COMBAT_5,The other crew member is in charge of the Automatic Cannon, don’t worry, they know what to do, so they’ll shoot it automatically from time to time.
TUTORIAL_COMBAT_6,Finally, a cannon to surpass steel gear… the <color=#0000FF><B>Big Purr Cannon</color></B>, you’ll notice when it’s ready, just tap the button and you’ll see the real power of the ball of yarn, it takes a long time to be ready, so hang on while it’s loading. 
TUTORIAL_COMBAT_7,That’s it from now, just remember the enemies may be different from time to time, you’re gonna face some strong Pirate Cats and sometimes you’ll just find some <B><I>Pirate School for Kitty Cats</B></I> recently graduated kittie pirates which will be super easy to deal with…
TUTORIAL_COMBAT_8,Anyways, time to prove to them who is the number 1 <B>Pirate Cat Crew!</B>
TUTORIAL_COMBAT_WEAKSPOT,You see that red spot in the enemy ship’s windows? It means they’re having troubles there, shoot it directly to cause bigger damage to they’re ship!
TUTORIAL_COMBAT_RESOURCES,One more thing, from time to time, the enemies are gonna drop boxes out of their ship, they think that'll make them stay afloat (how cute kitties), shoot them to break them and keep their resources to you!
